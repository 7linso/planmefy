## 🧠 Inspiration

Planmefy was born out of the idea to combine planning with live weather data to help users make smarter day-to-day decisions — all wrapped in a fast and beautiful web experience.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

I'm building **Planmefy** to push my skills in **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and both **front-end and back-end development**.

This project is like an **exam** for myself — something I’m creating entirely on my own, **independent of tutorials or courses**, from idea to implementation. I want to develop a real product with real features, not just a sandbox project.

More than code, I want to give this project **life and personality**, something that reflects **my passion, creativity, and dedication**. It’s also a way to **prove to myself** (and potential employers) that I’m ready to work as a **Junior Fullstack Developer**.
